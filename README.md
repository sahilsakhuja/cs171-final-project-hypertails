<h1> Hyperinflation - Is It Really Coming?  </h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Inflation has been the topic of 2021 in the US and across the world, initiated by COVID-19 pandemic that
disrupted the world's supply-chain system and caused price surge in many areas where supplies are short. In addition,
with almost year-long lockdowns and labor shortages, companies find it hard to get back to pre-pandemic production level.
The situation is made worse since with the money influx from the governments trying to boost the economy, together with record-breaking
level of savings (thanks to less personal and business travels, holiday spending, and dining-out),
people come out of the pandemic with huge cash piles. Increasing demand does not meet with increasing supply,
resulting in price surges in almost every category of the market.

On October 23, 2021 former Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey sent out a tweet claiming that "the US, followed by the rest of the world 
is entering a period of hyperinflation". This viewpoint made dramatic headlines in all leading publications This dashboard is built 
for people of all backgrounds to learn about and explore hyperinflation: what it is, which country is experiencing it, 
how the US inflation is compared with hyperinflation countries, and how inflation affect everyone's savings.

The dashboard contains four parts:
1. <b>Introduction</b>: Brief overview explaining what hyperinflation is and provide a prime example of a country with hyperinflation. 
2. <b>Inflation Across The World</b>: A visualization for users to explore average historical and current inflation of all countries around the world.
3. <b>Top Hyperinflation Countries</b>: A visualization for users to explore how real hyperinflation looks like and how inflation indicators are trending.
4. <b>US Inflation Trending</b>: A visualization for users to explore trending in US inflation and its inflation indicators.
5. <b>Inflation Thermometer</b>: A visualization for users to experience the impact of inflation on their savings and which type of expense is most costly.

<h2>Inflation Across The World</h2>
This visualization comes with two components: the world map and the brushing tool. Users can hover on each country they would like
to explore to see the average inflation rate for the timeline they select from the brushing tool. As users moves across the timeline,
the corresponding color on the map will change since inflation rates change over time. Darker shade represent a high inflation while
lighter shade mean low inflation.
<br />
<br />
By moving the brushing tool, users will have a big picture of how inflation develops over the time 
across the world and identify which country experiences high inflation for extensive period of time (darker shade remains with that country 
as users move brushing tool). The peak in brushing tool itself also reflects the period (1985-1995) in which a lot of countries experience
high inflation.

<h2>Top Hyperinflation Countries</h2>
This visualization contains 5 components: drop-down menu, line chart, donut chart, interactive legend, and brushing tool.
<br /><br />
Users can select from the drop-down menu the country of their preference and the line chart & donut chart will be activated and change
accordingly. They can use brushing tool to select the timeline and both charts  will adjust accordingly. Moreover, users can hover on
the donut chart and see details of each inflation indicator over time.
<br /><br />
Another feature is the interactive legend: users can turn any category on and off and the donut chart will reflect the change. 
Categories that are turned off will have light gray shade on the donut chart while the active categories will have their own colors.

<h2>US Inflation Trending</h2>
This visualization contains 2 components: line chart and interactive legend. Users can hover on each line and see details about
trending in inflation indicators (as users move along the line, tooltip will display more information). Also, when users hover
on a line, remaining other lines moves to background and appears in light gray shade so that the category of interest will be highlighted
and stands out.
<br /><br />
Each category in the interactive legend can also be turned on and off depending on which indicator the users want to explore.
This is useful when users would like to compare/contrast between two or more indicators.

<h2>Inflation Thermometer</h2>
This visualization serves as an exploratory tool for users to see the impact of inflation on their savings and how costly each
expense category would be as inflation goes up and down. Users enter their current income and expenses to start. As they adjust
the inflation rate, the savings will go up and down in the interactive chart and the expense amount for each category will change accordingly
as well.
<br /><br />
With this tool, users can have a quick guesstimate of their wealth as inflation increases or decreases. They also have a 
grab of which type of expense category that takes a big portion of their income; hence, make wise decision in curbing these expense if needed.
