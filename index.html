				<h3>What's Going On In Sudan?</h3>
				<p>
					Over the past 20 years, Sudan's economy has been in a rocky position, deteriorated firstly by the
					global financial crisis 2007-2008. Growth declined by 4% of GDP in 2009, from 10.2% in 2007 and
					6% in 2008. Lack of foreign investments and slowing economic growth resulted in
					higher tax and scaled-up custom duties to generate revenues to cover government's expenses. Without
					the influx of foreign currency through foreign investments, the government had to draw on its foreign
					reserves and pegged its currency to the Euro. Sudanese pound has sharply depreciated against the USD
					while inflation rate rocketed.
					<br>
					<br>
					The situation got worse following the aftermath of the ouster of former president in 2019 triggered
					by mass protest in the country.

				<p><span class="bigger">Hyperinflation</span> refers to rapid, excessive, and general price increases

				<p>Hyperinflations are usually caused by rapid growth of money supply to cover for large government expenditures.
					It is not uncommon to see hyperinflations in developing countries such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela, yet it has
					never been an issue to developed countries such as US or UK.
					</br>
					</br>
					However, since Covid-19, we have seen a huge disruption in supply chain as well as labor shortages that cause prices
					to increase sharply. According to the most recent data in October 2021, the US Consumer Price Index surged <span class="bold">6.2%</span>
					from a year ago, the biggest inflation surge in 30 years. Fuel oil prices soared <span class="bold">12.3%</span> in October 2021 while energy prices
					are up <span class="bold">30%</span> for 12-month period. All these factors have a big impact on the current recovery process of the economy post-Covid 19,
